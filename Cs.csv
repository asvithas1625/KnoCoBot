"1.9 Threading text blocks"
"All text in PageMaker resides inside containers called text blocks."
"A Text block can be connected to"
"other text block so that the text in one text block can flow into another text block. Text blocks that are connected in this way are threaded. The process of connecting"
"text among Text blocks is called threading"
"text. Text that flows through one or more"
"threaded blocks is called a story ."
"Once you have a loaded text icon,"
"you can use one of three text-flow options to place text in text blocks."
"To cancel a loaded text icon, click the"
"pointer tool in the toolbox; no text is deleted."
"A threaded text block can be"
"identified by a plus sign in its top and/or bottom handles. Refer Figure 1.23-Fig 1.25"
"Unthreaded text is where a text block"
"stands alone, without being connected to any other block. These blocks have nothing in their top and bottom handles."

"Adobe InDesign CC 2019 is a part of the"
"Adobe Creative Cloud family of software programs."
"InDesign is a page layout software"
"program used to design and produce documents that can be printed or used on the Web. Y ou can create anything from a simple business card to a large book."
"If we are working towards a career"
"as a Web designer, knowledge of InDesign is a must."
"2.2   Understanding Page"

"allows you to align and distribute objects by"
"their tops, bottoms, centers, or sides."
"Store items"
"Libraries are storage containers for items that you use repeatedly and want easy access to when working in InDesign. Company logos, legal jargon, and contact information are good examples of items to store in a library. Libraries look just like panels, but they are actually InDesign documents that are saved with the .indl extension. Libraries are not linked to one InDesign document; they can be opened and used with any InDesign documents."
"Create interactive buttons and"
"hyperlinks"
"In InDesign, you can use buttons and"
"hyperlinks to design clickable areas in a document that link to a Web page, another file, or another page in our document. Hyperlinks and buttons that are created in InDesign become usable (clickable) when you export an InDesign document as an Adobe PDF  (Portable Document Format)"
"document or as a Web format."
"Export documents"
"Y ou can export an InDesign document as another file type so that it can be used in another program. For example, you can export an InDesign document as a Flash Player file (SWF) or as a Flash Professional CS5 file (FLA)."

"Choose from many colors"
"InDesign contains many color samples, called swatches, to choose from. The Swatches panel includes the basic colors used for printed materials. There are also other color libraries to choose from for special purposes."
"For example, there is a library of"
"Web colors for documents created for the Web."
"Position objects easily"
"InDesign offers many features that help you position text and graphics with accuracy. Y ou can snap objects to ruler guides or a grid.

"2.5  Exploring the InDesign Workspace"
"A workspace is where your work is created. Workspaces typically include an area designated"
"for creating a finished product, much like a painter would use a canvas to create a painting."
"When you start InDesign for the first time, you see the default workspace, called"
"“Essentials, ” with the Control panel and Tools panel along the top and left side of the InDesign window. The arrangement of windows and panels that you see on your monitor is called the workspace. The InDesign workspace features the following areas: the document  window, pasteboard, Application bar, Control panel, Tools panel, and a stack of collapsed panels."

"Chapter 02  Adobe InDesign CC 2019InDesign CC 2019 offers a number of predefined workspaces that are customized"
"for different types of tasks. Each workspace in InDesign is designed so that panels with"
"similar functions are grouped together. For example, the Typography workspace shows the many type- and typography-based panels that are useful for working with type. Y ou can switch from one workspace to another by clicking Window on the application bar, pointing to Workspace, and then choosing a workspace."
"Application bar"
"The Application bar sits at the top of the workspace and includes several menus. To open a menu, click the menu name on the Application bar. Each menu lists commands that relate to the menu category. To the right of the menu names are workspace and view options."
"Figure 2.8  Application bar"
"Control panel"
"The Control panel is located directly beneath the Application bar and above the horizontal ruler. Options in the Control panel change depending on what is selected in the document. For instance, if your insertion point is flashing in text, you’ll see text options in the Control panel; if you use the black Selection Tool to select a graphic object, you’ll see different options for manipulating the graphic."
"Document tab"
"The document tab appears just above the horizontal ruler and includes the document’s name, its current magnification level, and a Close button. When more than one document is open, a tab appears for each document and the document tabs appear in a horizontal row. Click a document tab to view that document in the window. Y ou can drag a document tab out of the group to open it in a stand-alone window."
"Tools panel"
"The Tools panel contains the tools available in InDesign. There are tools for creating objects, such as the Rectangle tool, tools for transforming objects, such as the Rotate tool, and tools for changing the page view and navigating the workspace, such as the Zoom tool and the Hand tool. Some tools have a small triangle in the lower-right corner. This indicates that additional tools are available beneath that tool. Click and hold the tool to see the hidden tools."

"that you don’t lose anything that you’ve created."
"To save a document, click File on"
"the Application bar, and then click Save ."
"The first time that you save a new"
"document, the Save As dialog box opens, asking you to name the document and to choose a location in which to store it."
"Once saved, the new filename,"
"followed by the InDesign filename extension .indd, appears on the document tab."
"Once a document is named and"
"saved, you should continue to save your work on a regular basis, such as every 10 minutes. Y ou save the new document with a unique name."
"Figure 2. 9  File MenuPanels"
"Panels are small windows that contain options for working with selected objects. Y ou make choices in panels by clicking buttons, choosing items from lists, or using a command on the panel menu. Panels are positioned on the right side of the workspace and are identified by a name and an icon."
"Document window"
"The document window is the central area that represents the open InDesign  document. It resembles a piece of paper and is surrounded by a black border. The black border represents the page border."
"Pasteboard"
"The pasteboard is the gray area surrounding the document window. Y ou can place items on the pasteboard before actually inserting them on the page. Y ou can use areas of the pasteboard for temporary storage of the elements you’re working with—just drag the elements off the page, and they’ll stay on the pasteboard until you need them."
"Rulers"
"The horizontal and vertical rulers run along the top and left sides of the document window and pasteboard area. They are helpful for measuring and positioning objects."
"Status bar"
"The status bar is at the bottom of the workspace. The status bar gives you the status of what is going on at the moment. For example, the status bar shows which page is active in a multipage document."

"The Tools panel contains selection tools,"
"tools for drawing basic shapes, path-drawing and editing tools, transformation tools, text editing tools, navigation tools, and object formatting tools. By default, the Tools panel is docked under the Control panel. All tools are found in the Tools panel, located along the left side of your document window."
"If you place the cursor over any"
"tool in the Tools panel without clicking, a tooltip  appears displaying the tool’s name"
"and a keyboard shortcut in parentheses."
"Y ou can activate a tool by clicking"
"its icon, or by typing its assigned keyboard shortcut (which is included in the tooltip)."
"The first thing that you should"
"note about the Tools panel is that not all tools are visible; many are hidden. Look closely and you will see that ten tools have small white triangles in the bottom-right corner. These triangles indicate that other tools are hidden behind them."
"To access hidden tools, point to the"
"visible tool in the Tools panel, then press and hold the mouse button; this will reveal a fly- out menu of hidden tools. The small white square to the left of a tool name in the fly-out menu indicates the tool that is currently visible in the Tools panel."

"point of origin, and it is the point of the selected object that remains fixed during the transformation."
"Transformation Basics"
"There are many ways to transform an object in InDesign. Select the object using the Selection tool, then:"
"●●Drag a selection handle to scale the object (but not necessarily the contents of that object)."
"●●Select a transformation tool from the Tools panel, set the center of transformation (if necessary), and drag the tool."
"●●Display the Transform panel or Control panel and enter values in the 2. 16. 4  Transforming an Object"
"Transform is a term used to describe the act of moving an object, scaling it,  skewing it, or rotating it. Y ou can do all of the above in the Transform or Control panels."
"When you transform something,"
"you change its appearance. For example, you can rotate an object 45º or scale an object 50% to make it half its original size. The Transform commands in InDesign include Move, Scale, Rotate, Shear, and Flip. Y ou can also transform objects using buttons on the Transform panel or the Control panel. Y ou can change the width and height of an object and its location on the page. Before you transform an object, you choose a reference point from which"

"●●Select the Free Transform tool, and drag the tool around the object."
"●●Press keyboard shortcuts."
"There’s no “right” or “best” way to do transformations—you can experiment with the"
"different methods and see which you like best. We change methods depending on the situation (and our mood)."
"Modifying Corners and Strokes"
"In InDesign, you can modify the corners of a rectangular shape using the Corner Options"
"dialog box, which offers five types of corners, such as Rounded and Beveled. Like most dialog boxes, you can preview the settings applied to the selected object before closing the dialog box. To better see the changes made to corners, a thick stroke is recommended. Y ou change the weight of a stroke on the Stroke panel."

"Before you go anywhere in the Print"
"dialog box, you’ve got to make one or two important decisions. First, you must choose from the options on the Printer pop-up menu, which lists the printers you have installed on your computer. When you choose a printer, InDesign looks to the printer driver to see what PPD  (PostScript"
"Printer Description) file is associated with that printer, and it displays it—grayed out—in the PPD pop-up menu. In the case of a non-PostScript device, InDesign leaves this pop-up menu blank.General"
"The General pane of the Print dialog"
"box contains basic printing features: which pages do you want to print, how many copies do you want, and how do you want them to come out of the printer (see Figure 2. 50)."
"Copies"
"Enter the number of copies of the page you want to print in the Copies  field."
"Y ou can print up to 9999 copies of your publication."

"www.tntextbooks.in"
"Chapter 02  Adobe InDesign CC 201980"
"Collate"
"When you turn on the Collate option,"
"InDesign prints the range of pages you’ve specified, in order, for each copy of the publication you print. This makes for much slower printing. When you print multiple copies of a page, your printer only needs to process each page once (and then prints multiple copies of the page using the same image); when you turn on the Collate option, your printer must process each page once for every copy of the print job."
"Reverse Order"
"When you print a multipage document, do you want the first page to come out first or last? Turning on the Reverse Order check box tells InDesign to print the last page first, then print “backwards” to the first page. Y ou’ll want to turn this on if your pages come out of the laser printer face up."
"Page Ranges"
"Turn on the All Pages option to print all of the pages in the publication. To print a range of pages, turn on the Range option. Enter the page range in the Range field as shown in the following Table."
"To print Enter Example"
"A continuous"
"range of pagesfirst page - last page12-21"
"Up to a specific page- last page -5"
"From a page to the end of the documentfirst page - 5-"
"Non-contiguous pagespage, page 1, 3"
"Mixed page rangespage, range -3, 6-9, 12, 15-"
"Pages by section section:page Sec1:1, Sec2:5Sequence"
"To print even and odd pages, select the All"
"Pages option from the Sequence pop-up menu; to print even pages, select Even Pages Only; and to print odd pages select Odd Pages Only. These choices affect all page ranges, including page ranges you’ve entered in the Range field."
"Print Master Pages"
"Sometimes you need to print your master pages instead of your document pages. No problem: Just turn on the Print Master Pages check box. When you do this, you cannot specify page ranges—InDesign prints all the master pages in the document."
"Print Blank Pages"
"What happens when you print a three-page document that has nothing on page 2? By default, only pages 1 and 3 print out. If you want the blank page 2 to print, too, you’ d better turn on the Print Blank Pages check box."
"Print"
"Finally press the Print button to print the document"
"The Control panel has two"
"buttons that allow you to switch"
"between formatting characters and"
"formatting paragraphs. The two buttons are at the far left side of the panel. The Letter “ A ” button is the Character Formatting Controls button. Click this button to display options for formatting characters, such as Font Size, Superscript, and All Caps, on the left side of the Control panel. The ¶ button is the Paragraph Formatting Controls button. Click this button to display options for formatting paragraphs, such as alignment and indentation, on the left side of the Control panel."

Y ou can break the text frame into many individual frames and connect them all together so the story flows continuously through the individual pieces."
"points  to remember"
"●●InDesign is a page layout software program used to design and produce documents that can be printed or used on the Web."
"●●A workspace is where your work is created. Workspaces typically include an area designated for creating a finished product, much like a painter would use a canvas to create a painting."
"●●The default workspace in InDesign is called Essentials ."
"●●Panels are small windows that contain options for working with selected objects."
"●●The document window is the central area that represents the open InDesign  document."
"●●The pasteboard is the gray area surrounding the document window. Y ou can place items on the pasteboard before actually inserting them on the page."
"●●The status bar is at the bottom of the workspace. The status bar gives you the status of what is going on at the moment."
"●●If you place the cursor over any tool in the Tools panel without clicking, a tooltip appears displaying the tool’s name and a keyboard shortcut in parentheses."
"●●The Page tool is used for creating different page sizes within a document."
"●●Zooming allows you to quickly zoom in on, or get closer to, any object in your document."
"●●The view commands in InDesign are Zoom In, Zoom Out, Actual Size, Fit page in Window, Fit Spread in Window, Entire Pasteboard."
"●●Transform is a term used to describe the act of moving an object, scaling it, skewing it, or rotating it. Y ou can do all of the above in the Transform or Control panels."

"graphics and  bitmaps"
"There are two main types of computer graphics. They are vector graphics and bitmaps."
"Vector graphics"
"Vector graphics are made of lines"
"and curves. They are generated from mathematical descriptions. These graphics are ideal for logos and illustrations . As they are resolution-"
"independent graphics, they can be scaled to any size, or printed and displayed at any resolution, without losing detail and quality."
"Bitmaps"
"Bitmaps are also known as raster images."
"They are composed of small squares called pixels. Each pixel is mapped to a location in an image and has numerical colour values."
"As Bitmaps reproduce color"
"gradations well, they are excellent for photographs and digital paintings."
"Bitmaps are resolution-dependent"
"images which means that they represent"
"a fixed number of pixels. They look good at their actual size, but they appear jagged"
"Term Description"
"Object An object is an element in a drawing such as an image, shape, line,text, curve,"
"symbol, or layer."
"Drawing Drawing is the work you create in CorelDRAW , for example, custom artwork, logos, posters, and newsletters."

"two words, “multi” and “medium” . Multi refers to many i.e. at least two. Media is the plural of medium. Therefore multimedia is an integration of many types of media like text, graphics, images, audio, animation, video etc on a single medium in the same information unit."
"4.3  Components of"
"Multimedia"
"Multimedia has five major components like text, images, sound, video and animation. They are explained in detail below:"
"Figure 4.2  Components of Multimedia"
"4.3.1  Text"
"Text is the basic components of multimedia and most common ways of communicating information to other person. Even though multimedia includes images, video, audio and graphics, Text is the basic components used in multimedia."
"Figure 4.3  TextStatic Text"
"Static text, the text or the words will remain static as a heading or in a line, or in a paragraph. The words are given along with the images to explain about the images. In static text the words will either give information or support an image or an video."
"Figure 4.4  Static Text"
"Hypertext"
"A hypertext is a system which consists of nodes, the text and the links between the nodes, which defines the paths the user need to follow for the text access in non-sequential ways. The author of the working system created this structure. The user is permitted to define their own paths in more sophisticated hypertext systems. The user is provided with the flexibility and choice to navigate in hypertext. In a multimedia product Text is used to convey the information and must be placed at appropriate position in order to obtain the well-formatted sentences and paragraphs. The readability of the text depends on the spacing and punctuation. The message communication is more appropriate with improved Fonts and styles."

"Chapter 04  Multimedia and Desktop Publishing4.3.2  Image"
"Images acts as an vital component in"
"multimedia. These images are generated by the computer in two ways, as bitmap or raster images and as vector images."
"Raster or Bitmap Images"
"The common and comprehensive form of storing images in a computer is raster or bitmap image. Bitmap is a simple matrix of the tiny dots called pixel that forms a raster or bitmap image. Each pixel consists of two or more colors. Based on how much data, in bits is used to determine the number of colors, the color depth is determined. Eg. one bit is two colors, four bits means sixteen colors, eight bits indicates 256 colors, and so on."
"Vector Images"
"Drawing elements or objects such as lines, rectangles, circles and so on to create an images are based on Vector images. The advantage of vector image is relatively small amount of data is required to represent the image and thereby only less memory is needed to store. Compression techniques are used to reduce the file size of images that is useful for storing large number of images and speeding transmission for networked application. various Compression formats used for this purpose are GIF, TIFF and JPEG."
"Figure 4.6  Images"
"4.3.3  Animation"
"Animation is the process displaying still images so quickly so that they give the impression of continuous movement. In animation the screen object is a vector image in animation. Using numerical transformations the movement of that image along its paths is calculated for their defining coordinates. The least frame rate of at least 16 frames per second gives the impression of smoothness and for natural looking it should be at least 25 frames per second. Animations may be in two or three dimensional. The two dimensional animation, bring an image alive, that occur"

"on the flat X and Y axis of the screen. while"
"in three dimensional animation it occurs along the three axis X, Y and Z. Animation tools are very powerful and effective. The two basic types of animations are Path animation and Frame animation."
"Path Animation"
"Path animation involves moving an object on a screen that has a constant background e.g. a cartoon character may move across the screen regardless of any change in the background or the character."
"Figure 4.7  Animation"
"Frame Animation"
"In frame animations, multiple objects are allowed to travel simultaneously and the background or the objects also changes."
"4.3.4  Sound"
"Sound is a meaningful speech in any language and is the most serious element in multimedia, providing the pleasure of music, special effects and so on. Decibels is the measurement of volume, the pressure level of sound."
"Figure 4.8  SoundMusical Instrument Digital"
"Identifier (MIDI)"
"Musical Instrument Digital Identifier"
"(MIDI) is a standard communication  tool developed for computers and electronic instruments. This tool is flexible and easy  for composing the projects in multimedia. Tools for synthesizing the sound and software for sequencing are necessary for MIDI."
"Digital Audio"
"Sampled sound is a Digitized sound. A sample of sound is taken and stored every n"
"th fraction of a second as digital"
"information in bits and bytes. The quality of this recording depends on the sampling rate. sampling rate is defined as how often the samples are taken and how many numbers are used to represent the value of each sample (bit depth, resolution and sample size). The finer the quality of the captured sound and the resolution is achieved while played back, when more often the sample is taken and the more data is stored about that sample."
"4.3.5  Video"
"Video is defined as the display of recorded event, scene etc. The powerful way to convey information in multimedia applications are embedding of video. The video can be categorized in two types as Analog video and Digital video."
"Analog Video"
"In Analog video, the video data’s are stored in any non-computer media like video tape, laserdisc, film etc. It is divided further in two types as Composite and Component Analogue Video. Composite Analog Video has all the video components"

"DIB (Device Independent Bitmap)"
"This format which is similar to BMP , allows the files to be displayed on a variety of devices."
"GIF (Graphics Interchange Format)"
"GIF is a compressed image format. Most of the computer color images and backgrounds are GIF files. This file format is best suitable for graphics that uses only limited colors, and it is the most popular format used for online color photos. 13-bit Color look up table is used by the GIF format to identify its color values. This format is supported widely."
"JPEG (Joint Photographic"
"Experts Group)"
"JPEG was designed to attain maximum"
"image compression. It uses lossy compression technique, where a compression method is referred that loses some of the data required for the image reconstruction. It works good with photographs, naturalistic artwork, and similar material but functions less on lettering, live drawings or simple cartoons."
"TGA (Tagra)"
"It is the first popular format for high-resolution images. TGA is supported by Most of the video-capture boards."

"6.7.2  COORDINATE SYSTEMS"
"In AutoCAD, the location of a point is specified in terms of Cartesian coordinates. In this system, each point in a plane is specified by a pair of numerical coordinates. To specify a point in a plane, take two mutually perpendicular lines as references. The horizontal line is called the X axis, and the vertical line is called the Y axis. The X and Y axes divide the XY plane into four parts, generally known as quadrants. The point of intersection of these two axes is called the origin and the plane is called the XY plane."
"The origin has the coordinate values"
"of X = 0, Y = 0. The origin is taken as the reference for locating a point on the XY plane. Now, to locate a point, say P , draw a vertical line intersecting the X axis. The horizontal distance between the origin and the intersection point will be called the X coordinate of P . It will be denoted as P(x). The X coordinate specifies how far the point is to the left or right from the origin along the X axis. Now, draw a horizontal line intersecting the Y axis. minimum of two line segments are needed before a polygon can be created by the third closing segment.)"
"The Close option is used to join the"
"current point to the start point of the first line when two or more continuous lines are drawn. If you specify the endpoint by using the mouse, then click at the start point of the first line or enter C at the Command prompt, as given in the Command prompt below."

"Absolute Coordinate System"
"In the Absolute Coordinate System, points are located with respect to the origin (0,0). For example, a point with X = 4 and Y = 3 is measured 4 units horizontally (distance along the X axis) and 3 units vertically (distance along the Y axis) from the origin, as shown in Figure 6.57. In AutoCAD, the absolute coordinates are specified at the Command prompt by entering X and Y coordinates, separated by a comma."

"and the intersection point will be the Y coordinate of P . It will be denoted as P(y). The Y coordinate specifies how far the point is to the top or bottom from the origin along the Y axis. The intersection point of the horizontal and vertical lines is the coordinate of the point and is denoted as P(x,y). The X coordinate is positive, if measured from the right of the origin and is negative, if measured from the left of the origin. The Y coordinate is positive, if measured above the origin and is negative, if measured below the origin, refer to Figure 6.56."
